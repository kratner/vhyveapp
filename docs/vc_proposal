Executive Summary:
We are proposing a venture capital investment in a simultaneous mobile video streaming app with GPS capabilities. The app will enable users to stream live videos from different locations, simultaneously while showing their location on a GPS map. The app will cater to the needs of bloggers, social media influencers, travelers, and content creators looking to capture live events and showcase their location in real-time. Our app will differentiate itself from other video streaming apps in the market by offering a unique combination of GPS capabilities and real-time streaming, making it the ideal tool for travelers and digital nomads.

Market Analysis:
The video streaming market is rapidly growing, with the global market expected to reach $124.57 billion by 2025. The pandemic has further accelerated the demand for video streaming as people look for ways to stay connected and consume content remotely. With the rise of social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, the need for high-quality video content has become essential. Moreover, the rise of remote work and digital nomads has created a new market for location-based content.

Product Description:
Our app will offer a seamless and simple user experience, with easy navigation and user-friendly features. Users can select multiple locations and start streaming simultaneously, providing their followers with an immersive and real-time experience. The app will offer several features such as real-time GPS tracking, simultaneous streaming from multiple locations, the ability to save and edit video streams, and sharing capabilities on various social media platforms. The app will also allow users to monetize their content by integrating with existing ad networks and sponsorships.

Business Model:
We will monetize the app through subscriptions, in-app purchases, and advertisements. Our subscription-based model will offer premium features such as advanced editing tools, analytics, and the ability to stream from multiple devices simultaneously. In-app purchases will include additional filters, effects, and graphics to enhance the user experience. Advertisements will be integrated into the app, and users will have the option to opt-out by upgrading to the ad-free version.

Marketing Strategy:
Our target market will be bloggers, social media influencers, content creators, and travelers. We will use social media platforms and digital marketing campaigns to reach our target audience. We will also partner with popular travel bloggers and influencers to promote the app and encourage user-generated content.

Financials:
We project an initial investment of $2.5 million to develop and launch the app. We expect to generate revenue of $10 million in the first year, with an estimated net income of $3 million. We expect our revenue to grow by 50% year-on-year, with an estimated net income of $10 million by year five. We aim to achieve a valuation of $100 million by year five and exit through acquisition or IPO.

Conclusion:
We believe that our simultaneous mobile video streaming app with GPS capabilities will be the next big thing in the video streaming market. With its unique features and growing market demand, we see a massive opportunity for growth and profitability.
